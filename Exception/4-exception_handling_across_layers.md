# Exception Handling Across Layers in a C# Web API

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Domain Layer

**Purpose:**  
Maintain entity state and enforce business rules. Domain entities and aggregates ensure consistency and prevent violations of domain rules.

**Exceptions:**  
- **DomainException:** Thrown when a domain rule is violated, e.g.:  
    - `InsufficientFundsException` ‚Üí when the account balance is insufficient.  
    - `InvalidAmountException` ‚Üí when a deposit or withdrawal amount is invalid.  
    - `AccountNotFoundException` ‚Üí when an account does not exist.  
- **Input validation exceptions:** All input validation uses domain-specific exceptions, not system exceptions.

**Note:**  
System-level exceptions (e.g., database or I/O errors) generally do not occur in the Domain layer. The Domain focuses on enforcing business rules and validating inputs.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Layer

**Purpose:** Data access (DB, File, External APIs).

**Exceptions:**

- **DomainException:** Thrown when data is missing or domain rules are violated in the stored data (e.g., negative balance in DB that shouldn‚Äôt exist).  
- **SystemException:** System or database-related exceptions, such as:
  - `SqlException`
  - `DbUpdateException`
  - `TimeoutException`

**Behavior:** Repository typically does **not catch SystemExceptions**; they are allowed to **bubble up** to higher layers.

Exactly, according to **DDD and layered architecture principles**, putting a `try-catch` and directly throwing `SqlException` inside the Repository is generally **not recommended**.

### Reasons:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Repository = Data Access Only**

- The Repository's responsibility is solely to read/write data.
- It should not decide how errors are handled or throw domain-specific exceptions.
- Catching and wrapping a `SqlException` inside the Repository would introduce part of error handling logic into the Infrastructure layer, which is not correct from a DDD perspective.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **System Exceptions = Handled by Application Layer**

- Infrastructure-related exceptions like:
  - `SqlException`
  - `TimeoutException`
  - `DbUpdateException`
- Should be allowed to **bubble up to the Application Layer**, which can then decide whether to retry, fallback, or show an appropriate user message.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Exceptions in Repository Only in Special Cases**

- Only in cases where you really want to wrap or log the exception, you can use `try-catch`, but:
  - The original exception should still bubble up.
  - The Repository should **not embed domain logic or throw custom domain exceptions**.

üí° **Summary:**

- No, the Repository should **not throw `SqlException` itself**.
- Let the system exceptions bubble up naturally, and let the **Application/Domain Layer** decide how to handle them.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Service Layer

**Purpose:** Execute business logic and coordinate multiple repositories.

**Exceptions:**

- Mostly **DomainException**, e.g., when a combined business rule is violated.  
- Typically **does not catch SystemException**, unless implementing retry or fallback mechanisms.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Controller / Middleware (UI Layer)

**Purpose:** Receive requests, call the Service, and return responses to the client.

**Exceptions:**

- Any **DomainException** or **SystemException** bubbling up from Service or Repository layers.  
- Middleware catches these exceptions and converts them to proper HTTP responses (e.g., 400 for domain violations, 500 for system errors).
- So the idea is that SystemExceptions bubble up to the UI layer, where they are ultimately handled and logged‚Äîunless there is a specific reason to catch them earlier in the stack.

**Professional note:** In advanced architectures like **CQRS** or large-scale projects, logging is usually **not done in this layer**. Middleware only maps exceptions to responses, while centralized logging is handled elsewhere for consistency and observability.

# Professional Tip: Input Validation and Service Layer Responsibilities

- **Domain is the source of truth:** All core business rules and validations should be enforced inside the Domain.  
  *Example:* `Account.Withdraw` ensures that the balance is sufficient and the amount is positive.

- **Service orchestration:** The Service layer's main responsibility is to coordinate multiple Repositories or Aggregates and manage transaction logic or retry mechanisms.

- **Optional validation:** Input validation in the Service layer is only necessary if the operation involves multiple Aggregates or Repositories and the Domain cannot fully enforce it.

- **Avoid duplicate checks:** Re-validating inputs already checked by the Domain leads to redundant code and unnecessary complexity.

**Summary:** The Service layer **trusts the Domain to validate inputs** and focuses on executing complex scenarios and multi-step transactions.
