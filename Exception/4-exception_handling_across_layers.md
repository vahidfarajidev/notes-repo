# Exception Handling Across Layers in a C# Web API

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Domain Layer

**Purpose:**  
Maintain entity state and enforce business rules. Domain entities and aggregates ensure consistency and prevent violations of domain rules.

**Exceptions:**  
- **DomainException:** Thrown when a domain rule is violated, e.g.:  
    - `InsufficientFundsException` ‚Üí when the account balance is insufficient.  
    - `InvalidAmountException` ‚Üí when a deposit or withdrawal amount is invalid.  
    - `AccountNotFoundException` ‚Üí when an account does not exist.  
- **Input validation exceptions:** All input validation uses domain-specific exceptions, not system exceptions.

**Note:**  
System-level exceptions (e.g., database or I/O errors) generally do not occur in the Domain layer. The Domain focuses on enforcing business rules and validating inputs.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Layer

**Purpose:** Data access (DB, File, External APIs).

**Exceptions:**

- **DomainException:** Thrown when data is missing or domain rules are violated in the stored data (e.g., negative balance in DB that shouldn‚Äôt exist).  
- **SystemException:** System or database-related exceptions, such as:
  - `SqlException`
  - `DbUpdateException`
  - `TimeoutException`

**Behavior:** Repository typically does **not catch SystemExceptions**; they are allowed to **bubble up** to higher layers.

Exactly, according to **DDD and layered architecture principles**, putting a `try-catch` and directly throwing `SqlException` inside the Repository is generally **not recommended**.

### Reasons:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Repository = Data Access Only**

- The Repository's responsibility is solely to read/write data.
- It should not decide how errors are handled or throw domain-specific exceptions.
- Catching and wrapping a `SqlException` inside the Repository would introduce part of error handling logic into the Infrastructure layer, which is not correct from a DDD perspective.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **System Exceptions = Handled by Application Layer**

- Infrastructure-related exceptions like:
  - `SqlException`
  - `TimeoutException`
  - `DbUpdateException`
- Should be allowed to **bubble up to the Application Layer**, which can then decide whether to retry, fallback, or show an appropriate user message.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Exceptions in Repository Only in Special Cases**

- Only in cases where you really want to wrap or log the exception, you can use `try-catch`, but:
  - The original exception should still bubble up.
  - The Repository should **not embed domain logic or throw custom domain exceptions**.

üí° **Summary:**

- No, the Repository should **not throw `SqlException` itself**.
- Let the system exceptions bubble up naturally, and let the **Application/Domain Layer** decide how to handle them.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Service Layer

**Purpose:** Execute business logic and coordinate multiple repositories.

**Exceptions:**

- Mostly **DomainException**, e.g., when a combined business rule is violated.  
- Typically **does not catch SystemException**, unless implementing retry or fallback mechanisms.

# Application Layer Exception Handling & Logging Behavior

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step explanation for two common questions regarding exception handling in the Application layer of a DDD-based system.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Is it correct **not to put try/catch in the Application layer**?

‚úî **Yes, in this scenario it is correct**, because:

* The **Application layer** is responsible for executing the Use Case and enforcing Domain Rules, not for handling infrastructure exceptions like database failures.
* Exceptions such as `DbUpdateException` are **infrastructure-level errors** and are better handled and logged by **Middleware or Pipeline behaviors**.
* Adding try/catch in the Application layer for all database exceptions would make the code cluttered with boilerplate and could lose important log details.
* Instead, the exception is allowed to bubble up so that the Middleware decides:
  * What message to show to the user
  * What details to log

üí° **Principle:** The Application layer should handle **Use Case-specific exceptions** (e.g., `InvalidAmountException` or `AccountNotFoundException`) but let infrastructure exceptions propagate to Middleware for proper handling.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Will these exceptions be logged in the Logging Behavior?

‚úÖ **Yes, if you have a proper MediatR pipeline/Behavior logging setup**, these exceptions will typically be logged.

* In a MediatR Logging Behavior:

  * The request is logged **before** the handler executes.
  * The response or exception is logged **after** the handler executes.

* Exceptions thrown in the Application layer (e.g., `DbUpdateException`) are **caught by the Logging Behavior**, logged, and then rethrown.
* The HTTP Middleware can then produce an appropriate **500 Internal Server Error response**.

üí° **Note:** There are effectively two layers of logging:

1. **Pipeline/Behavior logs** ‚Äì mainly for internal debugging and detailed information.
2. **Middleware logs** ‚Äì for HTTP requests, monitoring, and user/system reporting.

---

### Step-by-step Exception Flow

1. **Application layer without try/catch**

   * If a handler like `TransferCommandHandler` throws an exception such as `DbUpdateException` and does not catch it, the exception propagates up to the **MediatR pipeline**.

2. **MediatR Logging Behavior**

   * A Logging Behavior wraps the handler:

     ```text
     LoggingBehavior -> TransferCommandHandler -> LoggingBehavior
     ```

   * When the handler throws an exception, the Behavior can **catch it, log it, and rethrow**.
   * Even without a try/catch in the handler, the exception is still logged.

3. **Middleware / UI Layer**

   * After passing through the Behavior, the exception reaches the Middleware.
   * Middleware processes the exception and produces a suitable **HTTP response** (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** Even without try/catch in the Application layer, exceptions are still logged by the Behavior and propagated upwards.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Controller / Middleware (UI Layer)

**Purpose:** Receive requests, call the Service, and return responses to the client.

**Exceptions:**

- Any **DomainException** or **SystemException** bubbling up from Service or Repository layers.  
- Middleware catches these exceptions and converts them to proper HTTP responses (e.g., 400 for domain violations, 500 for system errors).
- So the idea is that SystemExceptions bubble up to the UI layer, where they are ultimately handled and logged‚Äîunless there is a specific reason to catch them earlier in the stack.

**Professional note:** In advanced architectures like **CQRS** or large-scale projects, logging is usually **not done in this layer**. Middleware only maps exceptions to responses, while centralized logging is handled elsewhere for consistency and observability.

# Professional Tip: Input Validation and Service Layer Responsibilities

- **Domain is the source of truth:** All core business rules and validations should be enforced inside the Domain.  
  *Example:* `Account.Withdraw` ensures that the balance is sufficient and the amount is positive.

- **Service orchestration:** The Service layer's main responsibility is to coordinate multiple Repositories or Aggregates and manage transaction logic or retry mechanisms.

- **Optional validation:** Input validation in the Service layer is only necessary if the operation involves multiple Aggregates or Repositories and the Domain cannot fully enforce it.

- **Avoid duplicate checks:** Re-validating inputs already checked by the Domain leads to redundant code and unnecessary complexity.

**Summary:** The Service layer **trusts the Domain to validate inputs** and focuses on executing complex scenarios and multi-step transactions.
