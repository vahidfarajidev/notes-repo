# Understanding ASP.NET Core Identity

This article provides a comprehensive overview of ASP.NET Core Identity, covering its features, database structure, authentication methods, and key helper classes. It is structured in a Q&A format based on common questions.

## What is ASP.NET Core Identity?

**ASP.NET Core Identity** is a system for **authentication and user management** built into ASP.NET Core. It handles users, roles, passwords, sign-in/sign-out, two-factor authentication, and cookies/tokens.

In short, Identity provides a ready-made solution for **user security management**, so developers do not need to implement complex authentication logic from scratch.

## What are the main components of Identity?

1. **User**
   - Usually represented by the `IdentityUser` class.
   - Contains fields like `UserName`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `PhoneNumber`.
   - Can be extended with custom fields.

2. **Role**
   - Managed by the `IdentityRole` class.
   - Controls user access.
   - Example roles: Admin, Editor, User.

3. **UserManager & RoleManager**
   - `UserManager`: Manage users (create, delete, update password, retrieve info).
   - `RoleManager`: Manage roles.

4. **SignInManager**
   - Handles sign-in/sign-out and password validation.

5. **Stores**
   - Identity stores data in a database.
   - EF Core store is provided out-of-the-box.

## What features and key capabilities does Identity provide?

### Authentication
- Identity can authenticate users and manage **cookies**.
- By default, **JWT or access/refresh tokens are not provided**.

### Authorization & Roles
- Control access to parts of the application based on roles.

### Password Management
- Password hashing, reset, email confirmation.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Supports SMS, email, or authenticator apps.

### External Login
- Supports Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.

> **Important:** JWT and refresh tokens must be implemented manually if needed.

## How does Identity manage the database?

Identity generates database tables automatically via EF Core when using `IdentityDbContext`. Common tables include:

1. `AspNetUsers`: user info.
2. `AspNetRoles`: role info.
3. `AspNetUserRoles`: maps users to roles.
4. `AspNetUserClaims`: claims per user.
5. `AspNetUserLogins`: external logins.
6. `AspNetUserTokens`: tokens for password reset and email confirmation.
7. `AspNetRoleClaims`: claims for roles.

> Custom fields in `IdentityUser` will add new columns automatically.

## Does Identity handle access and refresh tokens?

- **No**, Identity does **not create JWT access tokens or refresh tokens** by default.
- Identity only manages **cookies** for web authentication.
- For API scenarios with JWT, you must **manually create tokens** after validating users using `UserManager` or `SignInManager`.
- Refresh tokens are typically stored in a separate database table linked to the user.

Example RefreshToken model:
```csharp
public class RefreshToken
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Token { get; set; }
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public DateTime ExpiryDate { get; set; }
    public bool IsUsed { get; set; }
    public bool IsRevoked { get; set; }
}
```

## How does authentication work in Identity?

### Cookie-based Authentication
- After login, Identity creates an authentication **cookie**.
- The browser sends the cookie with each request.
- Logout removes the cookie.
- This is suitable for **websites**.

### Token-based Authentication (Optional)
- For APIs, you can generate a **JWT** after validating the user.
- Identity validates the user, but you issue the JWT yourself.
- Client sends the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
- Access tokens are short-lived; refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens.

| Feature          | Cookie                  | Token (JWT)             |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Primary Use      | Web apps               | APIs / SPA             |
| Sent Automatically | Yes (browser)         | No, sent in header      |
| Stateless        | No                    | Yes                     |
| Storage          | Browser                | Browser / Mobile / Client |

## What are UserManager and SignInManager?

### UserManager<TUser>
- Handles **all user management operations**.
- Create, update, delete users.
- Password hashing and validation.
- Add/remove roles.
- Manage claims and tokens for email confirmation or password reset.

### SignInManager<TUser>
- Handles **sign-in/sign-out operations**.
- Validates credentials.
- Creates cookies for authentication.
- Supports external logins (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- Supports two-factor authentication (2FA).

| Feature        | UserManager           | SignInManager           |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Focus          | User data management | Sign-in & authentication |
| Example Ops    | Create, Update, Password | SignIn, SignOut, 2FA   |
| Cookie needed? | No                  | Yes                     |

## Summary

- ASP.NET Core Identity manages **users, roles, passwords, claims, and cookies**.
- JWT access tokens and refresh tokens are **optional** and must be implemented manually.
- `UserManager` is for managing user data, `SignInManager` is for authentication flow.
- Database tables are auto-generated by EF Core.
- Cookies are handled automatically for websites; tokens are custom for API/SPAs.
